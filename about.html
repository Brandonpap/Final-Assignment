                <p>I am an 18 year old with a passion for design. Some brands that I use for inspiration are "Primitive." which is a popular skate brand that has a graphic/street style. As well as a gym brand called "Young La." These brands have shaped my designs as well as myself as an individual but I am always open to new styles and trying new things. </p>

                <h3>Education</h3>

                <p>I took three years of beginner, intermediate and advanced classes for graphic design at Robert Thirsk High School, where I graduated in 2023. After graduating highschool, I enrolled in SAIT's interactive design diploma in the graphic design stream, where I am just about to finish my first year.</p>

                <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>

                <p>One of my biggest hobbies is the gym, I enjoy working out and trying to better myself physically. The gym has also allowed me to meet and connect with a variety of people with some of them becoming close friends.</p>
                   
                <p>I also enjoy skateboarding! I ride a 7.5-inch board with pretty loose bearings which others find hard to ride but I've become accustomed to it.</p>
                   
                <p>My last hobby/interest is boxing. I have a bag at my house that I like to practice on and I also spar friends from time to time.</p>
